# Desktop Inventory Control Application Plan

## Technology Stack for Desktop GUI

### Recommended: **PyQt6** or **PySide6**
- **Pros**: Professional-looking native apps, excellent widgets, good documentation
- **Cons**: Larger dependency, licensing considerations for PyQt
- **Best for**: Professional desktop applications

### Alternative: **tkinter** (Built into Python)
- **Pros**: No additional dependencies, simple to use
- **Cons**: Less modern appearance, limited widgets
- **Best for**: Simple applications or when minimizing dependencies

### Alternative: **CustomTkinter**
- **Pros**: Modern-looking tkinter, good for professional apps
- **Cons**: Additional dependency
- **Best for**: Modern look with tkinter simplicity

## Application Architecture

```
Desktop App (GUI)
    ├── Main Window (Navigation)
    ├── Inventory Module
    │   ├── Inventory List/Search
    │   ├── Stock Movements
    │   ├── Adjustments
    │   └── Reporting
    ├── Sales Orders Module
    │   ├── Order Creation
    │   ├── Order Management
    │   ├── Allocation
    │   └── Shipping
    ├── Pricing Module
    │   ├── Price Rules
    │   ├── Customer Pricing
    │   └── Promotions
    ├── BOM Module
    │   ├── Excel Integration
    │   ├── BOM Review
    │   └── Cost Analysis
    └── Reports Module
        ├── Dashboards
        ├── Analytics
        └── Export Options
```

## Proposed GUI Layout

### Main Window
- **Menu Bar**: File, Edit, View, Tools, Help
- **Toolbar**: Quick actions (New Order, Receive Inventory, etc.)
- **Navigation Panel**: Module icons/buttons (Inventory, Orders, Pricing, Reports)
- **Main Content Area**: Module-specific screens
- **Status Bar**: System status, notifications

### Key Screens Needed
1. **Dashboard** - Key metrics, alerts, quick actions
2. **Inventory Management** - Product list, stock levels, movements
3. **Sales Order Processing** - Create/edit orders, allocation
4. **Pricing Management** - Rules, customer pricing
5. **BOM Calculator** - Excel integration, component lists
6. **Reports & Analytics** - Various reports with export options

## Integration with Existing Backend

The GUI will use the existing service layer:
- `InventoryService` for all inventory operations
- `SalesOrderService` for order management  
- `PricingService` for pricing calculations
- `ExcelBOMService` for BOM processing
- `ReportingService` for analytics
- `DatabaseManager` for data access

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Framework
- [ ] Choose GUI framework
- [ ] Create main window structure
- [ ] Set up navigation
- [ ] Connect to existing database/services

### Phase 2: Essential Modules
- [ ] Inventory management screens
- [ ] Basic sales order creation
- [ ] Simple reporting dashboard

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Complete sales order workflow
- [ ] Pricing rule management
- [ ] BOM integration with Excel
- [ ] Advanced analytics

### Phase 4: Polish & Distribution
- [ ] UI/UX improvements
- [ ] Error handling & validation
- [ ] Package as executable
- [ ] Installation/deployment

## Technical Considerations

### Data Binding
- Use Qt's Model/View architecture or tkinter variables
- Real-time updates when data changes
- Form validation and error display

### Excel Integration
- File dialog for template selection
- Progress indicators for BOM calculations
- Preview/review screens for results

### Threading
- Background processing for long operations
- UI remains responsive during calculations
- Progress indicators and cancellation

### Error Handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Logging for debugging
- Graceful degradation

## Next Steps

1. **Choose Framework**: Recommend PyQt6/PySide6 for professional appearance
2. **Create Main Window**: Basic structure with navigation
3. **Build Inventory Module**: First functional module
4. **Iterate**: Add modules incrementally
